				<li>It's a dedicated space for students who would like to step-up and offer help on a specific project</li>

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">How can I be a part of BBB?</h2>
				<li>Simply <a href="/booking" class="font-bold underline">reserve</a> your slot at the BBB.</li>
				<li>This will be student managed, only fill out the times and projects you are open to helping.</li>
				<li>Please allow for different peers to try out BBB.</li>
				<li>Do not book the space for more than <span class="font-bold">4 hours</span> at a time!</li>
				<li>This timing can be <a href="/feedback" class="font-bold underline">negotiated</a> in future if we see fit as this is still after all, a trial Bocal project.</li>
